// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which you define what you would like your project to do"

const design = "This is the third step, in which you actually design and draw out what your project will do and how it will work"

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which you implement your software to see how it works"

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which you test your program and send it to everyone to integrate different parts of the software"

const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which you are keeping up with the software and constantly debugging and updating with new integrations for better software operation"
